              <h1>Hardeep Anand</h1>
              <h5>
                Founder and Director, OneWater Academy
              </h5>
              <h4>
                About
              </h4>
              <p>
                Hardeep Anand is recognized as a transformational executive and thought leader in integrated water resources management. Over a career spanning more than 20 years, he has consistently delivered top-notch performance and groundbreaking improvements for public and private organizations in South Florida. Mr. Anand has served as a torchbearer for operationalizing water resilience in Miami-Dade County through his active engagement with the 100 Resilient Cities and the Rockefeller Foundation as well as with various local, national and international organizations.  
              </p>
                <p>
                  Mr. Anand currently leads an $11.4 billion water infrastructure program in Miami-Dade County, which includes the implementation of State-mandated Ocean Outfall Legislation aimed at reducing nutrient loadings to water bodies, minimizing the use of ocean outfalls by 95 percent, and achieving 60 percent water reuse by the year 2025. Additionally, Mr. Anand oversees the planning, design and construction of a portfolio of more than 250 systemwide infrastructure development projects. He leads this charge with a vision of shifting from a transactional approach to water infrastructure planning, to one which will transform the water system in the region. 

                </p>

 
<p>
  As a champion of the “One Water” concept, Mr. Anand advocates for water governance across watersheds and a collaborative regulatory framework to prioritize water-related investments within the region. He spearheaded the development of the City Water Resilience Framework, which resulted in the selection of the Greater Miami and the Beaches region as one of only five areas from around the world to participate in creating a global blueprint for resilient urban water systems.  
</p>

<p>
  Understanding the inherent need for collaboration with various stakeholders in the region, Mr. Anand founded the Resilient Utility Coalition (RUC) to advance water infrastructure resilience efforts. Through RUC, partners from public utilities, private industry and academia are working together to operationalize policies and practice while making systems more resilient to hurricanes, infrastructure failure, increased precipitation, sea level rise and saltwater intrusion. Mr. Anand’s success with RUC has led to interdisciplinary and integrated planning that is improving water quality, public health and the efficient use of resources.  
</p>

<p>
  Keenly aware that industry must remain conversant with ever-shifting climate change issues, Mr. Anand is leading the development of a “OneWater Academy” knowledge sharing platform. He sees the mission of OneWater Academy as ensuring a sustainable and proficient workforce within the water sector by serving as a global clearinghouse for water-related information.
</p>
  
<p>
  Mr. Anand currently serves as policy director of the Resilient Utility Coalition, as a board member of the Water Research Foundation, as a commissioner on the U.S. Water Alliance National Blue Ribbon Commission for Onsite Non-potable Water Systems, and as a member of the University of Miami Construction Management Advisory Board.  
</p>

<p>
Originally from Tanzania, Mr. Anand is a registered professional engineer in the State of Florida and holds a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering, a Master of Science in Civil Engineering, and a Master of Science in Management of Information Systems

                </h1>
              <!-- <h5>
                Senior Vice President of the International Water Association
              </h5> -->
              <h4>
                About
              </h4>
              <p>
                Dr. Sudhir Murthy is Chief Executive Officer of NEWhub Corp.  He is also a Senior Research Scientist at Columbia University and Senior Vice President of the International Water Association. NEWhub is a cleantech company that specializes in managing technology and know-how for licensed distributors.  Sudhir through Columbia University also helps utilities and industries navigate their internal innovation and planning process.  Within IWA, Dr. Murthy serves as an officer and a board member and is currently leading its new innovation platform and programme. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Until May 2018, Sudhir was the Innovations Chief for DC Water and led the development and implementation of the Authority's innovation strategy. Sudhir created, defined and translated research and development into product, service and commercial technologies. Sudhir led the concept development for over $1 billion in new engineering and construction. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Much of the work led by Sudhir was steered through a worldwide open innovation approach that led to collaboration with universities, utilities, manufacturing and professional organizations.  These partnerships spanned the globe.  These innovative projects were developed though novel approaches of public-public partnership with other water utilities, and through collaboration with private enterprise and universities.   
                
              </p>
                 
                <p>
                  More than 80 MS and PhD students from universities in North America, Europe, Australia, Asia and Africa, were ‘insourced’ to innovate at DC Water in a multifunctional and interdisciplinary setting.  This approach is now viewed as a model for collaborative engagement by universities and utilities.   
                </p>
              
              
                <p>
                  Similarly, Sudhir developed commercial solutions through the development of public-private ‘open-innovation’ approaches between the water technology demand and supply sectors and through the co-development of technologies and financial innovations.  The Digestivore, DEMON, AvN, inDENSE, PdN and Triple A technologies for wastewater treatment are part of the commercial suite that he has led.  He has recently developed new financial instruments, ‘Res Bonds’, including the Resilience Bond and Restoration Bond that are green/climate bonds to promote holistic approaches for infrastructure investments. 
                </p>
             
                
                <p>
                  Sudhir led teams to win four Research Grand Prizes from the American Academy of Environmental Engineers and Scientists (AAEES) for new technologies developed in wastewater treatment and has received the Edward J. Cleary Award for Outstanding Service to the Profession. He has received several Water Environment Federation awards including the Ralph Fuhrman Medal for Academia-Practitioner Collaboration, the George Gascoigne Medal for Wastewater Treatment Operational Improvement and the Camp Applied Research Award.   
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  Sudhir has a M.S. in Environmental Engineering and Ph.D. in Civil Engineering from Virginia Tech and is a Professional Engineer.  He has over 130 peer review publications and over 250 publications or presentations.
