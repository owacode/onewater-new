              One Water Academy takes precautions to protect your information.
              When you submit sensitive information via the website, your
              information is protected both online and offline. Wherever we
              collect sensitive information (e.g. credit card information), that
              information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way.
              You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar
              and looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the
              webpage.

            <p>
              While we use encryption to protect sensitive information
              transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only
              employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for
              example, billing or customer service) are granted access to
              personally identifiable information. The computers and servers in
              which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a
              secure environment. This is all done to prevent any loss, misuse,
              unauthorized access, disclosure or modification of the user's
              personal information under our control.

              The company also uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) for authentication

            <p>
              If you answered "yes" to the question Does your website comply with the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR")? then the Privacy Policy above includes language that is meant to account for such compliance. Nevertheless, in order to be fully compliant with GDPR regulations your company must fulfill other requirements such as: (i) doing an assessment of data processing activities to improve security; (ii) have a data processing agreement with any third party vendors; (iii) appoint a data protection officer for the company to monitor GDPR compliance; (iv) designate a representative based in the EU under certain circumstances; and (v) have a protocol in place to handle a potential data breach. For more details on how to make sure your company is fully compliant with GDPR, please visit the official website at <a href="https://gdpr.eu" target="_blank">https://gdpr.eu.</a>  FormSwift and its subsidiaries are in no way responsible for determining whether or not your company is in fact compliant with GDPR and takes no responsibility for the use you make of this Privacy Policy or for any potential liability your company may face in relation to any GDPR compliance issues.

              COPPA Compliance Disclosure:
            </h4>
            <p>
              This Privacy Policy presumes that your website is not directed at children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from them or allow others to do the same through your site. If this is not true for your website or online service and you do collect such information (or allow others to do so), please be aware that you must be compliant with all COPPA regulations and guidelines in order to avoid violations which could lead to law enforcement actions, including civil penalties.
            </p>

            <p>
              In order to be fully compliant with COPPA your website or online service must fulfill other requirements such as: (i) posting a privacy policy which describes not only your practices, but also the practices of any others collecting personal information on your site or service — for example, plug-ins or ad networks; (ii) include a prominent link to your privacy policy anywhere you collect personal information from children; (iii) include a description of parental rights (e.g.  that you won't require a child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary, that they can review their child's personal information, direct you to delete it, and refuse to allow any further collection or use of the child's information, and the procedures to exercise their rights); (iv) give parents "direct notice" of your information practices before collecting information from their children; and (v) obtain the parents' "verifiable consent" before collecting, using or disclosing personal information from a child. For more information on the definition of these terms and how to make sure your website or online service is fully compliant with COPPA please visit <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/businesscenter/guidance/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule-six-step-compliance" target="_blank">https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/businesscenter/guidance/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule-six-step-compliance</a>.
