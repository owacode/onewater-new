              <p><strong>What is One Water?</strong></p>
              <p>
                Our planet has a finite amount of water. And in today’s complex
                world, there are many competing demands for this precious
                resource. Water demands for consumption, industrial uses,
                agriculture, ecosystems and healthy habitat needs. And water
                demands and stresses are only getting more challenging as
                population grows and our climate is changing.
              </p>
              <p>
                One Water is new way of thinking about how we value and manage
                water. One Water is based on the premise that all water has value.
                Not just potable water that we drink. But also wastewater that we
                can treat to serve non-potable demand or recharge groundwater
                aquifers. Rainwater and even urban stormwater can be recycled. The
                One Water framework looks at how to optimize the beneficial use of
                water in the entire water cycle. Considerations include recycling,
                capture, and storage. The end result is improved water quality,
                water resiliency and sustainability.

                &nbsp;One Water solutions can be implemented throughout the entire
                water cycle. It involves managing finite water resources for
                long-term resilience and reliability, meeting both community and
                ecosystem needs.
              </p>
              <p>
                One Water is an integrated planning and implementation approach to
                a managing finite water resources for long-term resilience and
                reliability, meeting both community and ecosystem needs. Many
                innovative utilities and cities across the US have embraced the
                One Water approach by taking a more holistic look at the water
                challenges and need for institutional collaboration and
                stakeholder engagement to develop sustainable solutions. The One
                Water approach is inclusive and first of all promotes
                collaboration by between water, wastewater, recycled water, and
                stormwater management utilities. But it goes beyond that. By
                embracing other “non-water” agencies and stakeholders, creative
                One Water solutions can be implemented.
              </p>

                For example, collaboration with transportation agencies can pave
                the way for large scale green infrastructure along new roads and
                railways in a cost-effective manner. By working together early in
                the planning process, smart water management approaches can be
                incorporated in design and construction by agencies that typically
                do not consider water footprint or water quality improvements. For
                example, the Los Angeles Zoo incorporated green stormwater
                infrastructure and water recycling for many animal exhibits in the
                LA Zoo Master Plan as a result of collaboration with the One Water
                LA team.

                One Water is a movement that is sweeping across the nation. This
                paradigm shift incorporates sustainable and resilient water
                management strategies for utilities large and small that balances
                urban, rural, and environmental benefits. Together we can
                transform the way we manage our finite water resources as
                <strong>One Water</strong>.
